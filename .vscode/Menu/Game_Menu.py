#Shows the Start button, leaderboard button, quit button
#Every one of these will do it's job and for sure the start one will be more complex
#We will need Entries , Sumbit buttons , Back button , Alot of windows i think
#also,A restart game menu for sure sqlite3 will be used in database i will see if i'll use matplotlib
#But i don't think i will need it and for the last step i will need to desgin it with some colors
